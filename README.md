# Slim

Slim is a simple weight management and goal tracking app. 

## Features

The app will consist of two main features: 

- A weight tracker; a place where you can keep a log of you weight loss or weight gain progress. 

- A social element where you can nudge your friends into making better daily decisions about their health. 

## Nice-to-have

- Connect and sync data from Wi-Fi scales.
- HealthKit integration.
- Exporting your data.

## Why?

The idea is that moderation and taking small steps are key to become a healthier person.

Diets don’t work, at least not for me and I bet a lot of people struggle with them as well, depriving yourself of something will ultimately cause you to fail. “I’m not eating pizza for 6 months”, fuck that. 😍🍕.

I’ve always been a fairly healthy and active person, but I went through a spell of about 2 years when I chose to sit in front of a screen instead of going to the gym. Now, I’m the healthiest I’ve been since that 2 year spell. It was a slow process, but the important thing is I got there.

## Similar Apps

[Weightbot](http://tapbots.com/software/weightbot/) is the only app that I’ve found that keep things as simple as I want them to be, it’s a great app but it’s outdated—the last update shipped in July 2010.

There are a huge amount of health related apps in the App Store, many of which try to do too much and some which are horribly executed. 

## Risks

I guess the biggest risk is that nobody uses the app, except for me. Another is that is gets completely lost in the App Store amongst the many other health related apps. 

I would consider the app a success if it helped a handful of people to considerably improve their health.
